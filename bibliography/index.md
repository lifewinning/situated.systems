This is a collection of books, articles, and other sources that were part of the research process of the Situated Systems team. To browse the bibliography, try searching basic keywords or browsing by specific tags. 

#### How did we make this? 

As we moved through our research, we gathered an array of reference material—journal articles, books, essays, and more—details of which we shared on a dedicated [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel. To aggregate these resources and make them accessible to the public, we developed an application for pushing URLs posted in Slack to [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) (code [here](https://gist.github.com/lifewinning/5007491ddf75b9d29512)), then used the Pinboard API to export our bibliography into structured data.
