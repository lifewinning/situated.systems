<h3><em>Situated Knowledges</em> is a zine series collecting interviews with people conducted as part of Situated Systems. In her essay "<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nqshmza7kd76xdx/Haraway1988.pdf?dl=0">Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of PartialPerspective</a>" (from which these zines took their name), Donna Haraway encourages researchers to recognize that their perspective reflects their specific experiences and identities. This suggests that collaboration and community are a way to situate oneâ€™s own knowledge, which is inevitably limited, in a larger context. To this end, we interviewed other members of the community and documented these interviews.</h3>
