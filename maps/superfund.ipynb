        "The CTS Printex Superfund Site comprises a number of properties and is situated in the northwest corner of the Santa Clara Valley between the south end of San Francisco Bay and the Santa Cruz Mountains in the City of Mountain View, California. CTS Printex operated a printed circuit board manufacturing facility within a 5\u00bd-acre portion of the area bounded by Plymouth, Colony, and Sierra Vista Streets from 1970 to early 1985.  Metals and degreasing compounds (e.g., organic solvents) were discharged to soil and groundwater during CTS Printex\u2019s manufacturing operations.  Investigation and remediation, including soil excavation and groundwater extraction, were undertaken by CTS Corporation and Nearon Enterprises between 1985 and 1996. \n",

        "The down-gradient portion of the Site bounded by Plymouth Street and Sierra Vista Avenue still requires additional monitoring, investigation, and potentially remediation for VOCs in groundwater; however, residual concentrations of VOCs in groundwater have been decreasing and are anticipated to continue to decrease over time. For one up-gradient portion of the Site,(Gables End, 1901-1950 Cambridge Drive, 841-862 Avery Drive, 1900-1929 Aberdeen Lane, 851-863 Donovan Way, 1901-1941 Newbury Drive) a risk management plan was developed, a restrictive covenant was recorded, and mitigation measures (e.g., vapor barriers and sub-slab ventilation systems) were implemented to address potential VOC concerns through the vapor intrusion pathway.  \n",

Each individual MEW Company is responsible for investigation, cleanup, and source control for soil and groundwater contamination at their individual facility-specific properties south of U.S. Highway 101.  Contaminated groundwater that has bypassed the source control areas and has mixed together with other contaminated groundwater from other source areas is considered part of the regional groundwater contamination plume, or the \u201cregional plume.\u201d \n",

The Navy and NASA Ames both operate groundwater extraction and treatment systems to contain and clean up contaminated groundwater at their areas of responsibility on Moffett Field, in addition to the regional system operating North of 101 on Moffett Field.\n",

The soil remedy includes: excavation, with treatment by aeration; and soil vapor extraction with treatment by vapor-phase granular activated carbon. The groundwater remedy includes: slurry walls (barriers beneath the surface) to contain contaminants; and extraction and treatment systems to contain and clean up groundwater contamination using granular activated carbon and/or air-stripping systems. \n",
        "Because the groundwater contamination at the MEW Site migrates northward and has mixed with contamination from sources at the NAS Moffett Field Superfund site, the groundwater remedy selected in the MEW Record of Decision also applies to the commingled regional groundwater contamination area on former NAS Moffett Field (the West-Side Aquifers), but not the entire former NAS Moffett Field facility.\n",
        "Intel Facility-Specific Work - 365 E. Middlefield Road\n",
        "Groundwater extraction at the former Intel Mountain View facility began in 1982 from one extraction  located on Lot 3 (365 East Middlefield Road). The well was completed across both the upper A Aquifer and the B1 Aquifer.\n",
        "Between 1982 and 1984, approximately 27.5 million gallons of groundwater were pumped resulting in an  approximately 1,600 pounds of VOCs removed. The extraction well was destroyed in 1984 when Intel conducted a source area removal action.\n",
        "In 1985, four new groundwater extraction wells were installed. Three of these wells were completed in the A Aquifer and one well was completed in the B1 Aquifer. EPA approved the shut down of extraction well PW-1A in 1996 after an investigation determined that taking the well off-line did not effect the overall capture zone at the facility.  Intel managed the operation of the extraction wells and treatment system and shares responsibility with Raytheon for the source control extraction well for Lots 3, 4, and 5, including Well I-1B2.\n",
        "The Intel groundwater treatment facility consisted of two 2,000-pound canisters of GAC operated in series.  Between June and August 1998, the treatment system was relocated from along the east side of the existing site building to a location near the southwest corner of the property in preparation for tenant improvements. Although changes were made to influent and effluent piping, no changes were made to the two liquid-phase GAC vessels.\n",
        "In 1998, a diffused aeration tank or air stripper was installed within the treatment pad enclosure to aerate the extracted groundwater prior to carbon absorption, thus decreasing the potential for exceedances of the NPDES effluent requirements. In April 2003, the use of the diffused aeration tank was discontinued and groundwater treated with GAC was plumbed to discharge to the City of Mountain View sewer. The system has the permitted option of discharging to a storm drain located along the eastern property boundary. The storm drain leads to Stevens Creek.\n",

        "The existing soil and groundwater remedy at the MEW Site does not address risks from long-term exposure through the vapor intrusion pathway. Since the issuance of EPA\u2019s 1989 Record of Decision, new information has been developed regarding the toxicity of TCE and potential vapor intrusion into buildings overlying shallow groundwater contamination. In 2003, as part of EPA\u2019s Five-Year Review of the MEW Study Area, EPA began evaluating whether VOCs in shallow groundwater are potentially migrating upward through the soils and cracks in the floors or through plumbing conduits and other preferential pathways, and impacting indoor air.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on indoor air sampling of both commercial and residential buildings in the area conducted in 2003 to 2007, EPA has confirmed the presence of the subsurface vapor intrusion pathway into a number of structures overlying the shallow groundwater TCE plume. None of the samples taken to date indicate any immediate or short-term health threat to building occupants from this pathway. EPA\u2019s main concern is whether the chemicals from the Site measured in indoor air pose an unacceptable risk of chronic health effects due to long-term exposure (25 years or more). It is EPA\u2019s policy not to set cleanup levels or take action to reduce levels that are less than ambient background levels.\n",
        "Some of the sampled buildings indicated indoor air contaminant concentrations that were elevated above background levels and above EPA Region 9\u2019s TCE interim action level in indoor air for long-term exposure. In each of these buildings, the MEW Companies and NASA have taken voluntary interim measures (e.g., sealing cracks/conduits, upgrading/modifying ventilation systems, installing air purifying systems) to reduce the indoor air contaminant concentrations. In addition, many new buildings in the MEW Study Area have taken measures to help prevent or mitigate the vapor intrusion pathway. Although EPA has not yet determined what the long-term mitigation and monitoring strategy should be for all buildings overlying shallow groundwater contamination, the results of these interim measures have generally reduced the indoor air levels thus far and are protective of residents and workers.\n",
        "In 2010, after amending the MEW Record of Decision, EPA selected a remedy that addressed potential long-term exposure of TCE, and other VOCs at unacceptable levels, through the vapor intrusion pathway,  For more information, please access the 2010 Record of Decision Amendment for the Vapor Intrusion Pathway document either by clicking here or finding it in the Records of Decision subsection of the Documents and Reports section below.\n",

        "The vapor intrusion remedy selected in the 2010 ROD Amendment for the MEW Site is expected to be protective of human health when fully implemented. In the interim, remedial activities completed to date have adequately addressed all exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks at the MEW Site. To be protective in the long-term, the vapor intrusion remedy implementation procedures need to be assessed to take into account the impact of the potential TCE short-term exposure risks on current MEW Site remedy operational framework. The groundwater remedy at the MEW Site is currently protective of human health and the environment because exposure to groundwater is being controlled. In order to be protective in the long term, the following recommendations and follow-up actions need to be completed: Determine the source of the TCE hot spot areas on Evandale Avenue and extent of TCE contamination in the A and B1 aquifer zones; Evaluate alternative cleanup strategies inside the slurry walls and implement treatability studies that do not necessarily require maintaining inward and upward gradients to control source area contamination; Evaluate and implement the current optimization pilot tests and treatability studies of alternative groundwater cleanup technologies at the facility-specific source areas, TCE hot spot areas, and representative areas of the regional groundwater contamination plume to expedite contaminant mass removal and cleanup timeframe; and Based on evaluation of the information collected, complete a Feasibility Study to evaluate remedial alternatives that can effectively meet the vapor intrusion remedial action objective to accelerate the reduction of the source of vapor intrusion (i.e., Site contaminants in shallow groundwater and soil gas) to levels that are protective of current and future building occupants, such that the need for a vapor intrusion remedy would be minimized or no longer be necessary. \n",

        "The Jasco Chemical Company Superfund Site (JASCO) consists of the property located at 1710 Villa Street in Mountain View, CA.  JASCO repackaged and formulated chemical products on the 2.05 acre Villa Street site from 1976 until December 1995.  Bulk solvents used at the site were received by tankers and stored in eight underground storage tanks. Prior to 1985, Tank #3 was used to store pentachlorophenol (PCP), which was an ingredient of a wood preservative formerly produced by Jasco. The product was discontinued in 1985, and the tank was converted to store paint thinner. Elevated levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected in soils from a swale area located behind the building and in the shallow groundwater. Past waste disposal practices, and possibly leakage from an underground storage tank and surface water, may have contributed to soil and groundwater contamination. The City of Mountain View has a total population of approximately 62,000. The only surface water body within one mile is Permanente Creek. Approximately 330,000 people within three miles of the site depend on groundwater for drinking water. In 1987, the City of Mountain View shut down one well near the site to determine whether site activities would affect the well. In 1988, after the investigations revealed that contamination had not migrated into the groundwater for this well, it was placed back into operation.\n",

Approximately 35 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the stockpile were treated on site using an ex-situ biotreatment process.  This process was an engineered design with combined ex-situ bioventing and fungal-based bioremediation technology to remediate the soil.  The biotreatment cell was constructed and operated from September 1997 through March 1998.  Confirmation sampling has shown that cleanup levels had been reached successfully in this area. \n",

        "Long-term Groundwater Cleanup\n",
        "\n",
        "In early 1991, the potentially responsible party, under EPA supervision, completed investigations into the nature and extent of groundwater contamination at the site. Treatability studies for soil cleanup were completed and, in 1992, a cleanup remedy was selected to address site contamination. During the winter of 1994, EPA approved the installation of a pilot-scale dual vacuum extraction (DVE)/soil vapor extraction (SVE) system for the drainage swale area of the site. The purpose of this pilot test was to evaluate DVE/SVE as a remedy for cleanup of the soil and groundwater. The pilot-scale system started operating in 1995. In April of 1997, in response to the appearance of PCE in groundwater near the southeastern corner of the warehouse facility, JASCO voluntarily converted a monitoring well to DVE.  After later sampling activities identified a shallow perched water-bearing zone above the A-aquifer in this area, JASCO constructed a second DVE well, screened within the perched zone, in October of 1997.  These wells were installed to remove PCE from the water table and shallow soil and to limit further migration of PCE in groundwater.  The expanded DVE system remained in operation until April of 1998, when an expanded groundwater extraction and treatment system was constructed.  EPA and the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) conducted an analysis and have concluded that JASCO is not the source of this PCE contamination.  Thus, JASCO will not be held responsible for cleaning up this PCE plume.  As a result, the groundwater must stay restricted until such time the appropriate authorities are able to address this non-related PCE contamination.\n",

EPA has reviewed this risk assessment and provided comments.  Redevelopment activities will not occur until the City of Mountain View has been assured that the construction plans are protective of human health and the environment.  As far as the PCE is concerned, EPA's Site Assessment Team is investigating the source of this contamination.

The deed restriction addressed a tetrachloroethene (PCE) plume, originating from an off-site source, which was not part of the JASCO site.

EPA  agrees with this conclusion.  Thus, JASCO is not responsible for cleaning up this PCE plume.  However, the PRPs will be held responsible for making sure this new PCE plume will not adversely impact redevelopment of the site.  They will be required to put a deed restriction in place that will prevent the migration of chemicals through the vapor intrusion pathway and continue to restrict the use of contaminated groundwater as drinking water.  \n",

Site investigations at several of these facilities during 1981 and 1982 revealed extensive soil and groundwater contamination, primarily volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  The primary causes of the contamination were leaking storage tanks and lines and poor facility management practices.  \n",

        "The contamination addressed in the MEW Record of Decision is both facility-specific and regional. Each individual MEW Company is responsible for investigation, cleanup, and source control for soil and groundwater contamination at their individual facility-specific properties south of U.S. Highway 101.  Contaminated groundwater that has bypassed the source control areas and has mixed together with other contaminated groundwater from other source areas is considered part of the regional groundwater contamination plume, or the \u201cregional plume.\u201d \n",

        "\n",
        "The MEW Regional Groundwater Remediation Program systems south and north of U.S. Highway 101 are designed to contain and clean up contaminated groundwater where the contaminated plume has mixed together with other contaminated groundwater and where the source of contamination has not been identified. The Navy and NASA Ames both operate groundwater extraction and treatment systems to contain and clean up contaminated groundwater at their areas of responsibility on Moffett Field, in addition to the regional system operating North of 101 on Moffett Field. \n",
        "It is important to note that groundwater currently is not used for drinking water or other potable uses.  Groundwater in the area is, however, a potential future source of drinking water and therefore groundwater cleanup standards have been established.\n",

        "\n",
        "Initial Actions\n",
        "Initial Actions: Initial cleanup activities currently being conducted at the site by the potentially responsible parties include tank removals, well sealing, soil removal and treatment, slurry wall construction around contaminated soil areas, and local groundwater treatment.\n",

        "\n",
        " Cleanup Ongoing \n",
        " In June 1989, EPA issued a Record of Decision selecting the soil and groundwater cleanup remedy for the MEW Site.  The soil remedy includes: excavation, with treatment by aeration; and soil vapor extraction with treatment by vapor-phase granular activated carbon. The groundwater remedy includes: slurry walls (barriers beneath the surface) to contain contaminants; and extraction and treatment systems to contain and clean up groundwater contamination using granular activated carbon and/or air-stripping systems. \n",
        "Because the groundwater contamination at the MEW Site migrates northward and has mixed with contamination from sources at the NAS Moffett Field Superfund site, the groundwater remedy selected in the MEW Record of Decision also applies to the commingled regional groundwater contamination area on former NAS Moffett Field (the West-Side Aquifers), but not the entire former NAS Moffett Field facility.\n",
        "Soil Cleanup\n",
        "350 Ellis Street A soil vapor extraction (SVE) system was installed at the 350 Ellis Street property, and immediately north of the slurry wall. The SVE system began operating in 1996, and included 135 vapor extraction wells and a vapor treatment system consisting of two 8,000-pound vapor-phase GAC units. The SVE system was decommissioned in 2000 after it had removed approximately 3,000 pounds of VOCs from the soils.  In 2000, EPA approved the soil cleanup for all SVE remediation areas at the property.\n",
        "During the demolition of the slab and foundation of the former 350 Ellis Street building in March 2000, TCE-contaminated soil was discovered adjacent to the eastern and southern walls of the former shipping and receiving loading dock. Approximately 440 tons of soil were excavated, characterized, and transported to Forward Landfill (a Class II facility) for disposal.\n",

        "In 1995, it was no longer practical to implement the SVE system designed for Lots 4 and 5 because of the rising groundwater table elevations. Soil samples in the remaining soils above the water table showed that soil concentrations met the cleanup levels. On May 20, 1996, EPA granted confirmation of the soil cleanup at Lots 3, 4, and 5.\n",

The wall was constructed to a depth of approximately 100 feet bgs around the facility property boundaries, encompassing the original chemical source areas at the facility.  Backfill material consisted of a low-permeability soil/bentonite mixture. The slurry wall encompasses the A and B1 Aquifer zones beneath the original facility, and partially penetrates the B2 Aquifer zone. \n",
        "Groundwater extraction wells were first installed at the site in the A and B1 Aquifers in 1986. Until 2000, extracted groundwater was treated using air stripping with a back-up liquid-phase carbon adsorption system to remove VOCs. The air stripper operated under an air permit from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, and final discharge of the treated effluent was discharged to Stevens Creek via the storm sewer system.\n",
        "In 1996, Raytheon added three extraction wells outside the slurry wall (RAY-1A, RAY-1B1, and I-1B2) as part of implementation of its facility-specific remedial design plans. Due to the redevelopment of the property in 2000, the groundwater treatment system was relocated. The relocated treatment system consisted of a low-profile air stripper with one liquid-phase GAC vessel that discharged treated groundwater to a storm sewer inlet onsite. The off-gas from the air stripper was routed through vapor-phase GAC vessels prior to discharging to the atmosphere. Between October 2002 and April 2003, there were four exceedances of 1,4-dioxane in the effluent.  An evaluation for treatment a technology that would treat 1,4-dioxane was conducted.\n",
        "On May 5, 2003, EPA approved Raytheon to shut down the air stripper and the carbon system while a new system was being evaluated.  Between May 20 and October 13, 2003, a temporary liquid-phase carbon system consisting of two 5,000-pound and one 2,000-pound vessels operated to treat the extracted groundwater. The treatment compound facility was modified in fall of 2003, and a new oxidation system was installed that could also treat for 1,4-dioxane and meet groundwater effluent discharge criteria. Full operations of the new treatment system began in December 2003.\n",

Since the issuance of EPA\u2019s 1989 Record of Decision, new information was developed regarding the toxicity of TCE and potential vapor intrusion into buildings overlying shallow groundwater contamination.  In 2003, as part of EPA\u2019s Five-Year Review of the MEW Study Area, EPA began evaluating whether VOCs in shallow groundwater are potentially migrating upward through the soils and cracks in the floors or through plumbing conduits and other preferential pathways, and impacting indoor air.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on indoor air sampling of both commercial and residential buildings in the area conducted in 2003 to 2008, EPA confirmed the presence of the subsurface vapor intrusion pathway into a number of structures overlying the shallow groundwater TCE plume. EPA\u2019s main concern is whether the chemicals from the Site measured in indoor air pose an unacceptable risk of chronic health effects due to long-term exposure (25 years or more). It is EPA\u2019s policy not to set cleanup levels or take action to reduce levels that are less than ambient background levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the sampled buildings indicated indoor air contaminant concentrations that were elevated above background levels and above EPA Region 9\u2019s TCE interim action level in indoor air for long-term exposure. In each of these buildings, the MEW Companies, Navy, and NASA implemented interim measures (e.g., sealing cracks/conduits, upgrading/modifying ventilation systems, installing air purifying systems) to reduce the indoor air contaminant concentrations.\n",

While in operation, these former facilities required the storage, handling, and use of a variety of chemicals, particularly volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The primary chemicals of concern at the MEW Site are trichloroethene (TCE) and its degradation products: cis-1,2-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride. During operations, some of the chemicals leaked or were otherwise released to the ground, impacting soil and groundwater. In 1981 and 1982, investigations in the area of these facilities indicated that significant levels of contaminants had been released to the soil and groundwater.   \n",

Each individual MEW Company is responsible for investigation, cleanup, and source control for soil and groundwater contamination at their individual facility-specific properties south of U.S. Highway 101.  Contaminated groundwater that has bypassed the source control areas and has mixed together with other contaminated groundwater from other source areas is considered part of the regional groundwater contamination plume, or the \u201cregional plume.\u201d \n",

The Navy and NASA both operate groundwater extraction and treatment systems to contain and clean up contaminated groundwater at their areas of responsibility on Moffett Field, in addition to the MEW regional groundwater system operating North of 101 on Moffett Field. \n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note that groundwater currently is not used for drinking water or other potable uses.  Groundwater in the area is, however, a potential future source of drinking water and therefore groundwater cleanup standards have been established.\n",

        "Remedy Selected\n",
        "EPA's Soil and Groundwater Remedy - 1989\n",
        "In June 1989, EPA issued a Record of Decision selecting the soil and groundwater cleanup remedy for the MEW Study Area.  The soil remedy includes: excavation, with treatment by aeration; and soil vapor extraction with treatment by vapor-phase granular activated carbon. The groundwater remedy includes: slurry walls (barriers beneath the surface) to contain contaminants; and extraction and treatment systems to contain and clean up groundwater contamination using granular activated carbon and/or air-stripping systems. \n",
        "Because the groundwater contamination at the MEW Site migrates northward and has mixed with contamination from sources at the NAS Moffett Field Superfund site, the groundwater remedy selected in the MEW Record of Decision also applies to the commingled regional groundwater contamination area on former NAS Moffett Field (the West-Side Aquifers), but not the entire former NAS Moffett Field facility.\n",
        "Intel, Fairchild, and Raytheon implemented groundwater and soil source control measures in the 1980s, before the soil and groundwater remedy was selected. Based on extensive soil and groundwater investigations and studies at the MEW Site, the MEW Companies implemented soil and groundwater cleanup programs that included soil excavation and treatment, installation of four slurry walls, soil vapor extraction and treatment systems, and groundwater extraction and treatment systems.\n",
        "In the mid-1990s, Fairchild Semiconductor, Raytheon, Intel, and other MEW Companies (SMI, Vishay/SUMCO, NEC Electronics) implemented the soil remedy by excavation and aeration and soil vapor extraction (SVE).  They also began operating or continued to operate the groundwater extraction and treatment systems to control source areas and remove VOCs from the aquifers. The soil cleanup was completed in 2001.  \n",
        "In accordance with the Consent Decree and 106 Order, each of the MEW Companies operates and maintains individual facility-specific groundwater source control measures (i.e., extraction wells, slurry walls, treatment systems, etc.) to contain and clean up contamination source areas in each area for which the MEW Company is responsible.\n",
        "The MEW Regional Program South of 101 began operation in January 1998; North of 101 began operation in October 1998.  The South of 101 and North of 101 are two separate groundwater extraction systems; however, they are designed to operate in unison to remediate and capture the regional plume.  The Navy\u2019s West-Side Aquifers Treatment System (WATS) began operation in November 1998, and NASA\u2019s groundwater extraction and treatment system began operation in September 2001.\n",
        "EPA's First Five-Year Review  (2004)\n",
        "The existing soil and groundwater remedy at the MEW Site does not address risks from long-term exposure through the vapor intrusion pathway. Since the issuance of EPA\u2019s 1989 Record of Decision, new information has been developed regarding the toxicity of TCE and potential vapor intrusion into buildings overlying shallow groundwater contamination.  In 2003, as part of EPA\u2019s First Five-Year Review of the MEW Superfund Study Area, EPA began evaluating whether VOCs in shallow groundwater are potentially migrating upward through the soils and cracks in the floors or through plumbing conduits and other preferential pathways, and impacting indoor air.\n",
        "\n",
        "EPA's First Five-Year Review determined that for the groundwater remedy to remain protective in the long-term, the following actions need to be taken:  long-term protectiveness should continue to be verified by monitoring the extent of groundwater contamination along the estimated groundwater contamination plume boundaries. This evaluation should be accomplished through routine annual groundwater sampling events. Current data indicate that the remedy is functioning as required to meet the remedial action objectives; however, EPA recommends optimization of both the regional and facility-specific systems to enhance plume capture, evaluation of applicable technologies to potentially expedite contaminant mass removal and cleanup time, and evaluation of the potential need for institutional controls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Current actions\n",
        "Intel has mplemented an in-situ bioremediation pilot test at its former facility at 365 East Middlefield Road in Mountain View to try to reduce VOC concentrations in the \u201chot spot\u201d areas in a shorter period of time. \n",
        "The MEW Companies, Navy and NASA have prepared a work plan to evaluate other alternate groundwater cleanup technologies to address the MEW Site-wide groundwater contamination.\n",
        "In 2010, after amending the MEW Record of Decision, EPA selected a remedy that addressed potential long-term exposure of TCE, and other VOCs at unacceptable levels, through the vapor intrusion pathway,  For more information, please access the 2010 Record of Decision Amendment for the Vapor Intrusion Pathway document either by clicking here or finding it in the Records of Decision subsection of the Documents and Reports section below.\n",

        "The 11\u00bd-acre Spectra-Physics, Inc., site has been the location of a manufacturer of electronic equipment and gas lasers since 1961.  Beginning in 1981, Spectra-Physics, Inc. stored its hazardous wastes on bermed concrete pads.  Only one storage area has a cement floor without a berm, and that area is used for storing solid wastes.  A variety of cleaners, degreasers, and lubricants are used in the manufacturing process.  Wastes from manufacturing processes include volatile organic compounds (VOCs), paints, oils, acids, and bases.  In 1981, the State discovered areas where hazardous wastes were stored that had no dikes or leachate collection systems.  Additionally, several on-site wastewater sumps are suspected of contributing VOCs to the soils and groundwater.  Contaminated groundwater from the site has moved off site to the north and merged with the contaminated plume of another NPL site, the Teledyne Semiconductor, Inc. site, which borders the Spectra-Physics, Inc. site.  The two firms are jointly cleaning up the sites.  Approximately 189,000 people live within a 3-mile radius of the site.  The closest residence is located 200 feet southwest of the site.  San Francisco Bay is 2\u00bd miles downstream of the site and is used for recreation.  The tides that influence the Bay also influence Permanente Creek, which is within 1 mile of the site.  Several species of endangered birds are found within the area of tidal influence. \n",

        "Initial Actions:  In 1987, one wastewater sump was removed, and 6 feet of surrounding soils were excavated.  In 1986 and 1988, an on-site shallow groundwater extraction well and one intermediate zone groundwater extraction well were installed.  These wells were installed to prevent the plume of contaminants from migrating off site.  Twenty additional wells were installed and have begun extracting groundwater from the off-site contaminant plume areas. Extracted groundwater is discharged to the City of Palo Alto sanitary sewer system.  All actions were performed by Teledyne and Spectra-Physics.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " Cleanup Ongoing \n",
        " Since the late 1980s, Teledyne and Spectra-Physics have operated onsite and offsite groundwater extraction wells to remove TCE and hydraulically control the groundwater plume. In 2003, most of the groundwater extraction system was shut down due to decreased pollutant mass removal efficiency. In 2003, the Responsible Parties (RPs) pilot-tested and monitored natural attenuation for two years and concluded that this approach would not attain cleanup standards in a reasonable time.\n",
        " \n",
        "In 2006, the Regional Board directed the RPs to re-characterize the Teledyne source property using high-resolution investigation technology to help focus further cleanup efforts. This work discovered and delineated previously unknown TCE hot spots at the site. In 2011, the dischargers pilot-tested an \u201cin situ\u201d method: enhanced bioremediation with recirculation. This involved injecting a carbohydrate solution as a food source for naturally occurring microbes, adding a microbial solution to accelerate the bioremediation process, and re-circulating the carbohydrate/microbe solution through a system of extraction and injection wells. The microbes consumed the carbohydrate solution and destroyed the TCE in place, creating harmless dechlorination byproducts such as carbon dioxide and salts.\n",
        " \n",
        "The pilot study reduced groundwater-TCE levels from as high as 80,000 parts per billion (ppb) to below 100 ppb, and in some wells to less than 5 ppb (the cleanup standard). This work is ongoing. \n",

        "A protectiveness determination of the remedy at the Teledyne Semiconductor and Spectra-Physics, Inc. Joint Superfund Sites cannot be made at this time until further information is obtained. Additional vapor intrusion assessments must be conducted to determine if indoor air pathways are complete. When unacceptable levels are encountered in a particular building, mitigation plans are developed and implemented to ensure that levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor air are protective. It is expected that these actions will take approximately two years to complete, at which time a protectiveness determination can be made. To be protective in the long-run, a new remedy should be selected due to the declining effectiveness of the existing remedy.   \n",

        "Teledyne Semiconductor has operated as a semiconductor manufacturer at this 1-acre site since 1962.  In 1982, Teledyne reported to the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB) that soil and groundwater were contaminated with solvents from an underground solvent storage tank.  The State inspected the site and found that contaminants had migrated north of the site and affected approximately 50 private domestic wells.  Furthermore, contaminated groundwater that migrated north from another NPL site, Spectra-Physics, Inc., merged with the contaminated plume of the Teledyne site.  The two firms are cleaning up the sites jointly.  These sites are among the 28 sites in the South Bay Area of San Francisco. Facilities at these sites have used a variety of toxic chemicals, primarily chlorinated organic solvents, which have contaminated a common groundwater basin.  Although the sites are listed separately on the NPL, the EPA intends to combine cleanup activities at some of the sites as part of an area-wide approach to the contamination.  The site is located in a densely populated, urban area.  Approximately 189,000 people live within a 3-mile radius of the site.  The distance from the site to the nearest residence is 200 feet.\n",

        "Since the late 1980s, Teledyne and Spectra-Physics have operated onsite and offsite groundwater extraction wells to remove TCE and hydraulically control the groundwater plume. In 2003, most of the groundwater extraction system was shut down due to decreased pollutant mass removal efficiency. In 2003, the Responsible Parties (RPs) pilot-tested and monitored natural attenuation for two years and concluded that this approach would not attain cleanup standards in a reasonable time.\n",
        " \n",
        "In 2006, the Regional Board directed the RPs to re-characterize the Teledyne source property using high-resolution investigation technology to help focus further cleanup efforts. This work discovered and delineated previously unknown TCE hot spots at the site. In 2011, the dischargers pilot-tested an \u201cin situ\u201d method: enhanced bioremediation with recirculation. This involved injecting a carbohydrate solution as a food source for naturally occurring microbes, adding a microbial solution to accelerate the bioremediation process, and re-circulating the carbohydrate/microbe solution through a system of extraction and injection wells. The microbes consumed the carbohydrate solution and destroyed the TCE in place, creating harmless dechlorination byproducts such as carbon dioxide and salts.\n",

        "The pilot study reduced groundwater-TCE levels from as high as 80,000 parts per billion (ppb) to below 100 ppb, and in some wells to less than 5 ppb (the cleanup standard). This work is ongoing. \n",

        "A protectiveness determination of the remedy at the Teledyne Semiconductor and Spectra-Physics, Inc. Joint Superfund Sites cannot be made at this time until further information is obtained. Additional vapor intrusion assessments must be conducted to determine if indoor air pathways are complete. When unacceptable levels are encountered in a particular building, mitigation plans are developed and implemented to ensure that levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor air are protective. It is expected that these actions will take approximately two years to complete, at which time a protectiveness determination can be made. To be protective in the long-run, a new remedy should be selected due to the declining effectiveness of the existing remedy.   \n",

        "The contamination addressed in the MEW Record of Decision is both facility-specific and regional.  Each individual MEW Company is responsible for investigation, cleanup, and source control for soil and groundwater contamination at their individual facility-specific properties south of U.S. Highway 101. Contaminated groundwater that has bypassed the source control areas and has mixed together with other contaminated groundwater from other source areas is considered part of the regional groundwater contamination plume, or the \u201cregional plume.\u201d \n",

        "The MEW Regional Groundwater Remediation Program systems south and north of U.S. Highway 101 are designed to contain and clean up contaminated groundwater where it has mixed together with other contaminated groundwater and where the source of contamination has not been identified. The Navy and NASA both operate groundwater extraction and treatment systems to contain and clean up contaminated groundwater at their areas of responsibility on Moffett Field, in addition to the regional system operating North of 101 on Moffett Field.\n",

        " Remedy Selected \n",
        " In June 1989, EPA issued a Record of Decision selecting the soil and groundwater cleanup remedy for the MEW Site.  The soil remedy includes: excavation, with treatment by aeration; and soil vapor extraction with treatment by vapor-phase granular activated carbon. The groundwater remedy includes: slurry walls (barriers beneath the surface) to contain contaminants; and extraction and treatment systems to contain and clean up groundwater contamination using granular activated carbon and/or air-stripping systems. \n",

Groundwater extraction was initiated in the mid-1980s to control and clean up sources in the groundwater. The system was expanded and currently includes 12 source control extraction wells both inside and outside the slurry wall. The MEW Regional Program operates three wells outside the slurry wall.

        "The 1989 soil and groundwater remedy at the MEW Site did not address risks from long-term exposure through the vapor intrusion pathway. Since the issuance of EPA\u2019s 1989 Record of Decision, new information was developed regarding the toxicity of TCE and potential vapor intrusion into buildings overlying shallow groundwater contamination.  In 2003, as part of EPA\u2019s Five-Year Review of the MEW Study Area, EPA began evaluating whether VOCs in shallow groundwater are potentially migrating upward through the soils and cracks in the floors or through plumbing conduits and other preferential pathways, and impacting indoor air.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on indoor air sampling of both commercial and residential buildings in the area conducted in 2003 to 2008, EPA confirmed the presence of the subsurface vapor intrusion pathway into a number of structures overlying the shallow groundwater TCE plume. EPA\u2019s main concern is whether the chemicals from the Site measured in indoor air pose an unacceptable risk of chronic health effects due to long-term exposure (25 years or more). It is EPA\u2019s policy not to set cleanup levels or take action to reduce levels that are less than ambient background levels.\n",
        "Some of the sampled buildings indicated indoor air contaminant concentrations that were elevated above background levels and above EPA Region 9\u2019s TCE interim action level in indoor air for long-term exposure. In each of these buildings, the MEW Companies, Navy, and NASA implemented interim measures (e.g., sealing cracks/conduits, upgrading/modifying ventilation systems, installing air purifying systems) to reduce the indoor air contaminant concentrations.\n",
        "In 2010, EPA amended the MEW Record of Decision and selected a remedy that addressed potential long-term exposure of TCE, and other VOCs at unacceptable levels, through the vapor intrusion pathway,  For more information, please access the 2010 Record of Decision Amendment for the Vapor Intrusion Pathway document either by clicking here or finding it in the Records of Decision subsection of the Documents and Reports section below.\n",

Impacted groundwater emanating from the former Varian facility at 601 California Avenue, the former HP facility at 395 Page Mill Road and other release sites in the vicinity comingle with the impacted groundwater plume from the HP Site. The comingled impacted groundwater plume extends generally to the northwest about one-half mile. Land use in the off-site area overlying the impacted groundwater plume is a mix of commercial, residential and recreational. \n",

Former Site buildings were demolished, and construction of a new multi-story office building with an engineered vapor intrusion barrier and a ventilated underground parking garage was completed in 1994. The office building and surrounding at-grade parking lots encompass the majority of the former HP Site. \n",

        "Site investigation began in 1981 after a leaking 1000-gallon underground solvent storage tank was discovered at the Site. Since then extensive investigation and cleanup activities have been conducted. Cleanup measures have included excavation of over 10,000 cubic yards of soil, soil vapor extraction and treatment and groundwater extraction and treatment in on- and off-site areas. Ongoing groundwater extraction and treatment has reduced the plume dimensions and plume concentrations.\n",

        "Extensive investigation and cleanup has been conducted since discovery of a release from a 1,000-gallon underground waste solvent tank in 1981. Interim remedial measures included excavation and off-site disposal between 1987 and 1992 of approximately 10,700 cubic yards of soil, construction and operation (beginning in 1994) of a soil vapor extraction and treatment (SVET) system; and groundwater extraction and treatment  beginning in 1987 and continuing.\n",

        "These interim response actions addressed the principal threats at the former HP Site - soil and groundwater contamination. The final remedy was selected in 1995 and implemented beginning in 1995 and 1996. The final remedy addresses threats that remained after the interim measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "The major components of the selected remedy included the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "-\tOperation of the on-Site soil vapor extraction and treatment (SVET) system. The SVET system was operated regularly until 1996 when shutdown testing was conducted. The SVET system has not operated for any significant time since August 1997 due to saturation of the gravel packs in the lower wells and low VOC concentrations in the other SVE wells.\n",
        "\n",
        "-\tOperation of the on-site and off-site groundwater extraction system to capture and treat VOC-impacted groundwater.  Groundwater extraction and treatment activities currently consist of extraction from two on-Site and two off-Site extraction wells and treatment of extracted groundwater from those wells at the treatment system at the former HP Site; and operation of a treatment system for the Oregon Expressway Underpass (OEU) dewatering system.  The OEU dewatering system was installed beneath the underpass when it was constructed in 1958, and controls natural groundwater inflow and surface runoff. \n",
        "\n",
        "-\tLong-term groundwater monitoring. Groundwater monitoring and reporting is conducted annually.\n",

        "\n",
        "Additional off-Site investigations were conducted in 2011 to further delineate the extent of VOC-impacted groundwater (i.e. plume definition) in support of a subsequent vapor intrusion investigation.  Based on the results of the impacted groundwater delineation efforts, work plans for indoor air testing of residential and commercial buildings were developed, received regulatory agency approval, and were implemented during 2012 through mid-2015. Air testing results from the vapor intrusion investigations showed elevated levels of TCE vapors in some subgrade structures (elevator shafts, underground parking garages).  However, the testing has showed that there are no unacceptable accumulations of vapors in homes or workspaces.\n",

Through mid-2015 this study has included 34 single-family residences, eight (8) multi-family or mixed use properties (some with multiple buildings) and 13 commercial buildings.  All of the single-family residences were offered testing and 12 accepted testing.  Seven (7) of eight (8) multi-family or mixed use properties were tested.  Testing was also conducted at ten (10) of 13 commercial buildings.\n",

The Five-Year Review concluded that the cleanup remedy for the site currently protects human health and the environment because exposure to the contaminated groundwater is not currently possible and the vapor intrusion study did not find unacceptable vapor levels in currently occupied living or work spaces.\n",

        "Recommendation: Evaluate the need for revisions to the current remedy to address potential future unacceptable vapor intrusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Issue #2: The California Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene has decreased since the signing of the Record of Decision (ROD) and is more stringent than the current ROD cleanup level.\n",

        "The 22-acre Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. (Fairchild) facility (former South San Jose Plant or Site) is located west of Highway 101 about nine miles southeast of downtown San Jose near the intersection of Monterey Highway and Highway 85. The Site is located in a light industrial and commercial area. The plant was constructed between 1975 and 1977 and used for electronics and semiconductor fabrication from 1977 to 1983.  Solvents containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs; primarily 1,1,1-TCA) were used at the Site. Other chemicals, such as acids, were also used and stored at the Site. The Site was vacant from 1983 until it was redeveloped and reoccupied in 2000. From 1979 until 1987, Fairchild was a wholly owned subsidiary of Schlumberger Technology Corporation (STC).  STC sold Fairchild to National Semiconductor Corporation in 1987, but retained the Site.   STC sold the Site to a commercial developer in 1990. The Site was redeveloped as a retail shopping center (commercial) by parties other than STC in 2000. STC has remained the responsible party for Site cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "Initial investigations were conducted in November/December 1981 and determined that compounds of concern (COCs) were in soil and groundwater at the Site.  The investigation identified a single source: a 5,940-gallon underground waste storage tank. The COCs included 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (Freon 113), 1,1,1-TCA, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, tetrachloroethene, xylenes, and 1,1-DCE, which is a degradation product of 1,1,1-TCA. \n",
        "In 1981, samples from Great Oaks Water Company drinking water supply well GO-13, located down-gradient from the Site, contained 1,1,1-TCA. 1,1,1-TCA was one of the COCs detected in soil and groundwater near the underground tank at the Site. Well GO-13 was taken out of service in December 1981 and used for remediation until it was sealed in October 1986. \n",
        "Remedial action at the Site began in 1982 with the removal of the underground waste storage tank and associated piping. Additional facilities that were removed in 1982 included an acid waste tank, concrete holding vault, concrete slab beneath the former waste solvent tank, and a temporary waste solvent tank. After removal of the underground waste storage tank in 1982, about 3,400 cubic yards of soil were excavated from the vicinity of the tank to a total depth of 52 feet below grade. Groundwater extraction at the Site was also initiated in 1982 to control migration of COCs. \n",
        "In 1986, Fairchild constructed a slurry cut-off wall around the Site to a maximum depth of 148 feet to create a physical barrier to prevent off-property migration of COCs. Groundwater extraction and treatment (GWET) continued inside and down-gradient from the slurry wall enclosure until 1998 and 1991, respectively. Soil excavation and construction of the slurry wall were complete and the GWET system and groundwater monitoring program were implemented by the time the Final Site Cleanup Requirements Order (SCR) was adopted in 1989. \n",
        "As indicated above, groundwater remediation began at the Site in 1982. Fairchild identified and closed all supply wells in the area that were impacted by COCs. With concurrence from the Regional Water Board, Fairchild suspended groundwater extraction and treatment in July 1998 after demonstrating that asymptotic VOC concentrations and other conditions had been reached. During operation of the GWET system between 1982 and 1998, a total of 93,285 pounds of VOCs were removed from groundwater.\n",
        "A soil vapor extraction and treatment (SVET) system was operated at the Site in 1989 and 1990 to treat and remove COCs in air pores located in soil above groundwater. The SVET was removed in 1995 with Regional Water Board approval when Fairchild demonstrated that soil cleanup standards established in the SCR had been achieved. A total of 15,906 pounds of VOCs were removed by SVET. \n",
        "In total, approximately 147,000 pounds of VOCs were removed from the Site through soil excavation, groundwater extraction, and soil vapor extraction. In 1998, the Regional Board approved suspension of active remediation at the Site. Fairchild has continued monitoring of on-Site and off-Site groundwater and of the slurry cut-off wall since 1998 and providing annual reports to the Regional Water Board. \n",

All private supply wells located in the area surrounding the site have been sealed or abandoned. The plume of groundwater containing COCs has been significantly reduced through extraction, treatment, and natural attenuation, and the potential health threat posed by ingesting groundwater contaminants continues to decrease. In 2009, the Regional Water Board and EPA evaluated the potential for COCs migrating through vapor intrusion (VI) into surface uses at the Site.  The evaluation found no unacceptable risk of VI. At the request of the Regional Water Board and EPA, Fairchild re-evaluated the potential VI risks in 2014. Fairchild\u2019s evaluation concluded that residual COCs in groundwater do not present a health risk to on-Site or off-Site buildings from VI.  EPA and the Regional Water Board are currently reviewing Fairchild\u2019s conclusions regarding the VI pathway.\n",

Between 1982 and 1998, on- and off-Site groundwater extraction wells operated to control the migration of groundwater COCs and remove COC mass. Between 1982 and 1986, pre-existing supply wells that were potential pathways for COC migration to deeper groundwater were sealed. A slurry wall was built around the perimeter of the Site in 1986 to prevent off-Site migration of COCs.\n",

The following cleanup remedies were selected in the SCR:  treating on-Site soil using a vapor extraction process; continued pumping on-Site shallow groundwater and off-Site groundwater and treating it using air stripping and carbon adsorption, followed by on-Site reinjection of the treated groundwater; pumping deep groundwater from off-Site wells, followed by air stripping and discharging to surface water using storm drains, or reuse of the treated groundwater for road construction and irrigation; conducting laboratory and field studies to determine the effectiveness of biodegradation on on-Site chemicals; implementing deed restrictions to limit groundwater and land use; and monitoring groundwater. Groundwater monitoring and the deed restrictions remain active. The other cleanup remedies have ceased with Regional Water Board approval or are complete.\n",

The removal and treatment of soil, the closure of private wells, the operation of the groundwater treatment system, and the installation of the slurry wall have reduced the potential for exposure to hazardous substances at the Site. Natural attenuation has also reduced concentrations of COCs in groundwater over time.  Of the seven Site COCs, only 1,1-DCE (a degradation product of an original solvent used at the Site) was regularly detected above groundwater cleanup goals between 2009 and 2013. During this period, only one off-Site monitoring well was regularly above the cleanup goal of a hazard index of 0.25. \n",

The groundwater plume has been reduced and contained. In the meantime, institutional controls are in place to prevent exposure. There is no exposure risk from vapor intrusion. To be protective in the long term, however, the Fifth Five Year Review recommends that certain additional issues be considered.

        "\tThe Lorentz family began a drum recycling operation on a 6.72 acre portion of a 10.5 acre Lorentz Barrel & Drum Co. property in 1947.  During the early years of operation, portions of the property were sold or leased to other companies.  Eventually, the size of the Site was reduced to a 5.25 acre parcel.  The Site received over two million drums from more than 3,000 parties in connection with the recycling business operations until it was closed by a court action brought by the California Department of Health Services (DHS) in July 1987.  The facility received drums that contained aqueous wastes, organic solvents, acids, oxidizers, and waste oils.  The drums were reconditioned through a variety of methods including caustic and acid washing, incineration, blasting with steel shot, and steam cleaning.  The residues and cleaning materials were dumped into sumps and basins on-site which then drained to a storm sewer.  The reconditioned drums were resealed and repainted with substances such as phenolic epoxy resins, rust inhibitors and lead-based paints.  The drums were either returned to the original owner or sold.\n",

The inspector discovered that the source the Lorentz Barrel and Drum facility (\"the Lorentz facility\").  In response to the waste inspector's concerns, the Lorentz facility owner temporarily redirected the untreated recycling waste discharge from the storm sewer to on-site basins and sumps.\n",
        "\n",
        "\tBetween 1980 and 1985, several State agencies issued numerous violations against the facility owner for the inappropriate handling and storing of hazardous substances, as well as for releases into the storm sewer.  In 1985, the Department of Health Services (\"DHS\") cited the Lorentz facility with 14 violations of the California Administrative Code and Federal Regulations concerning the inappropriate handling and storage of hazardous wastes.  The Santa Clara County Attorney obtained a Temporary Restraining Order to close down operations at the Lorentz facility, and the Lorentz facility was permanently closed in July 1987.  In 1984, EPA proposed the Site to be listed on the National Priorities List (NPL).  In 1989, the Site was listed on the NPL. \n",

        "DHS assumed responsibility for the Site in 1982 and conducted a soil investigation.  In 1987, response actions at the site by EPA and DHS included a series of removal actions in which drums, heavily contaminated soils, buildings, tanks, and sumps were removed and taken off-site for proper disposal.  DHS's contractor excavated contaminated soils and EPA conducted sampling and removed abandoned drums from the Site.  In addition, EPA's contractor drained and disposed hazardous liquids from the on-site storage tanks.  In the same year, DHS referred the Site to EPA.  In 1988, EPA and DHS excavated an additional 3,000 cubic yards of highly contaminated soils from the sump and basin areas of the Site and removed 26,000 drums containing hazardous substances and other wastes. The Site was also fenced off and the areas of the Site with the highest levels of contaminated surface soils were paved with a temporary asphaltic cap to prevent direct human contact with the surface soils and to control dust and erosion.   In 1994, a group of potentially responsible parties (\"PRPs\") completed a two-phase removal of contaminated buildings, and sumps, debris, drums, and asbestos waste.\n",

The first ROD issued was the Operable Unit 2 (OU2) ROD (1988) which is for the shallow zone groundwater.  The OU2 ROD selected pump and treat technology for the shallow zone groundwater remedy at the Site.  The remedy is to control the shallow groundwater plume\u2019s off-site migration.   Shallow zone groundwater treatment is expected to continue for 30 years.\n",

The OU1 ROD called for contaminated subsurface soil removal, vadose zone soil vapor extraction, capping the Site, and deep zone groundwater monitoring.  The OU1 ROD included remedial actions to remediate VOC-contaminated soil on-site and to encapsulate the soils contaminated with metals and organics.\n",

        "  In 1990, EPA  started a semi-annual groundwater monitoring program for the deep aquifer and entered into a Consent Decreee (\"Lorentz CD\") with 11 Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs).  The Lorentz CD directed the PRP group to design, construct, and operate a shallow groundwater extraction and treatment system as described in the OU2 ROD.  Construction of shallow groundwater extraction wells and the Ultraviolet/ Oxidation-Granular Activated Carbon (UV/Ox-GAC) treatment facility began in 1991.  The PRPs completed the construction in 1992 and have operated the treatment plant since 1992.\n",
        "\n",
        "The OU1 ROD remedial activities included construction of a cap, installation and operation of a soil vapor extraction (SVE) system, development of a deep zone groundwater monitoring program, and implementation of institutional controls at the Site.  In 1992, EPA signed an Administrative Consent Order with seven PRPs to remove and dispose of the remaining drums, asbestos, site debris, structures, and sumps.  This work was later included in the OU1 ROD, and the work was complete by the PRPs in 1994.  The OU1 remaining preliminary tasks were completed prior to 1997.  The final phase of the OU1 remedy, the construction of an asphaltic cap and the installation of an SVE system, was completed in September 1998.\n",
        "\n",
        "EPA  issued an Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) for the groundwater remedy (OU2) in April 1998.  This ESD allowed the change of the UV/Ox-GAC groundwater treatment system to a GAC filter only treatment system.  This change increased the treatment efficiency and significantly reduced operation and maintenance costs.  In May 1998, EPA issued an ESD for the OU1 remedy.  This ESD changes the final soil remedy under the OU1 ROD to off-site disposal of  stockpiled soil instead of retaining the soil on-site, which reduced initial construction costs and also provided flexibility for the future Site use.  \n",

        "The site was constructed in about 1970 and is located at 3050 Bowers Avenue, a light industrial and commercial area of Santa Clara.  A large industrial building occupies most of the site.  Most buildings in the vicinity are low-rise developments containing office space and research and development facilities.  The facility has been used to manufacture equipment for the fabrication of semiconductor wafers from 1974 to the present. During the 1970s, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) were used as industrial solvents for cleaning and degreasing.  Acids, caustics, and other chemicals were also used at the facility.  The site is located in the Santa Clara Valley, a structural basin filled with marine and alluvial sediments.  The natural groundwater flow direction beneath the site is to the north towards San Francisco Bay.  Municipal water supply wells tap an extensive, deep, regional, confined aquifer that lies generally greater than 200 to 300 feet below ground surface (bgs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Groundwater at the site is contaminated with Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), primarily of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA), 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA), and 1,1-dichloroethene (1,1-DCE). In November 1983, VOCs were discovered in a monitoring well down gradient from three Underground Storage Tanks (USTs) on the west side of the large building.  Site investigation began shortly after the contamination was discovered.  Groundwater monitoring and extraction wells were installed and groundwater extraction began in November 1984. In January 1985, Applied Materials removed the tanks, excavated the contaminated soils, and constructed a groundwater extraction pit.\n",
        "\n",
        "The site overlies the Santa Clara Valley groundwater basin. Groundwater from this basin provides up to 50% of the municipal drinking water for over 1.4 million residents of the Santa Clara Valley. The site became a Superfund site primarily because of the past chemical releases' potential threat to this valuable groundwater resource.\n",

The system consists of three extraction wells, an extraction pit, and a dual-column air stripper.  In 1985, underground storage tanks and some of the surrounding soil were excavated, and an excavation pit was built.  In addition, a down-gradient extraction well and a second deep monitoring well were installed to determine the extent of contaminant migration.  When the groundwater treatment plant was operating, the treated groundwater was discharged to a storm drain system, which flows into San Tomas Aquino Creek and South San Francisco Bay.\n",

In 1993, it was determined the surface soils are not contaminated and that the saturated soils under the building would be cleaned through the groundwater remedy.\n",

In 1990, the EPA chose to continue using the existing pump and treat system, installed in 1984, to remove contaminants from the groundwater.  Groundwater extraction began in 1985 and continued through 2002 until contaminant concentrations in groundwater approached declining, asymptotic levels.  The pump and treat system operation was discontinued in 2002. Chemical attenuation and plume stability monitoring is ongoing. \n",

        "The Intel Corp. (Santa Clara 3) facility performed quality control of chemicals and tests microprocessors at this four-acre property. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are present in the groundwater in the shallow aquifer zone; however the source of the groundwater contamination was never found on the property. This site is one of 28 EPA National Priorities List (NPL) or Superfund sites in the South San Francisco Bay Area (South Bay). Generally, a variety of toxic chemicals, primarily chlorinated organic solvents, such as trichloroethene (TCE) were used at the South Bay sites, and were subsequently released to the soil and groundwater. As a result, the groundwater basin has been contaminated . \n",

        "In 1985, the potentially responsible party installed and began operating a groundwater extraction and treatment system until 1993.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " Cleanup Ongoing \n",
        " In 1990, under EPA oversight, Intel completed an investigation of the nature and extent of contamination at the site. The remedy selected by the EPA in 1990 included:  groundwater extraction and treatment with an expanded granular activated carbon system to treat the groundwater, discharging the treated groundwater to San Tomas Aquino Creek; monitoring groundwater; and performing a demonstration project to evaluate various groundwater pumping strategies for cleaning up residual VOCs left behind in aquifer material. \n",
        "\n",
        "Several pumping scenarios were evaluated in an effort to optimize the efficiency of the groundwater extraction and treatment system and in 1991 Intel implemented a cyclic pumping strategy until July 1993.  VOC concentrations were leveling off, and the groundwater extraction and treatment system was no longer effective at recovering significant quantities of contaminants.  Therefore, the groundwater extraction was turned off in July 1993, and natural attenuation monitoring began.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the period of groundwater extraction, approximately 45 million gallons of groundwater were extracted and treated. Approximately 28 pounds of TCE, the primary contaminant, had been removed. The majority of contaminant mass was removed during the first few years of operation of the groundwater extraction system. Deed restrictions for use of the property were put into place in 1992 and modified in 2008. The deed restriction prohibits the drilling of groundwater wells for domestic or industrial use and restricts the land use.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2006, Intel prepared a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) to compare the ROD-selected groundwater extraction and treatment remedy to other remedial alternatives, such as in-situ remediation technologies. The purpose of the FFS was to determine what other technologies can be implemented in order to achieve more effective and efficient cleanup of the remaining low- level groundwater contamination. Based on the findings of the FFS, Intel performed an in-situ chemical oxidation treatability study at the Site. Intel injected a controlled subsurface oxidizing reaction that reduces VOC concentrations.  The alternative technology did not reduce the remaining contaminant concentrations to achieve the ROD cleanup levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "In December 2007,  Intel prepared a Chemical Oxidation and Technical Impracticability Evaluation Report.  This report stated that groundwater restoration at the Site would not likely occur under further pumping or non-pumping conditions in a reasonable timeframe, due to the complex site geology and matrix diffusion,   However, since 2007 all but one well have achieved the cleanup goals. \n",
        "\n",
        "In 2010, EPA amended the ROD to use Monitored Natural Attenuation to address the remaining low levels of TCE in the groundwater.  MNA involves letting naturally occurring physical, chemical, and/or biological processes reduce the amount of contaminants in groundwater.\n",
        "\n",
        "In March 2010, Intel conducted indoor air sampling to evaluate whether vapor intrusion could expose future building occupants to Site contaminants.  There was one detection of vinyl chloride and one detection of TCE, but both were well below EPA Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) for industrial indoor air.\n",
        "\n",
        "June 2011: EPA completed a fourth Five Year Review for the site and determined that the remedy  is protective of human health and the environment.  The groundwater contamination has been reduced to below drinking water standards in all but a very limited area; the remedy is expected to achieve drinking water standards site-wide and be protective for the long-term.  Any groundwater exposure pathway that could result in unacceptable risks is currently being controlled through a land use covenant that restricts soil excavation and certain types of property development,  and prohibits the drilling of groundwater wells.\n",

        "The Intel Magnetics site is a 1-acre facility that produced and tested magnetic products and computer memories. Micro Storage occupied the site from 1985 to 1986 and used the facility for research and development and pilot manufacturing. Micro Storage also occupied a property adjacent to and upgradient from the site that contributes to the contamination. Monitoring wells on the site are contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), believed to have resulted from surface spills and a leak from an underground storage tank. This is one of 28 NPL sites in the South Bay Area of San Francisco. Facilities at these sites have used a variety of toxic chemicals, primarily chlorinated organic solvents, which have contaminated a common groundwater basin.  Approximately 300,000 people depend on groundwater within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water. Twenty Santa Clara wells and four Sunnyvale wells are located within a 3-mile radius of the site.\n",

The contaminants of concern are primarily chlorinated organic solvents, which, along with other nearby National Priority List (NPL) sites, have contaminated a common groundwater area.  Although these nearby sites are listed separately on the NPL, the cleanup activities  at some of the sites are being coordinated as part of an area-wide cleanup approach.  Approximately 300,000 people live within 3 miles of the site and depend on groundwater as a source of drinking water.\n",

        "In 1974, Synertek Inc. (Synertek) leased the building located at 3050 Coronado Drive in Santa Clara, California (Building No. 1), where it conducted semiconductor manufacturing operations. In 1979, Honeywell acquired Synertek as a wholly owned subsidiary. Synertek manufacturing operations ceased in 1985. Prior to 1985, Synertek constructed and operated two underground tank systems east of the building. One 200-gallon-capacity solvent tank was used for storing solvents between 1976 and 1982 and three former neutralization system tanks were used between 1974 and 1982 as holding tanks. These tanks stored a variety of chemicals, including chlorinated solvents. The tanks leaked volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the soil. The quantity of solvents released by these tanks and the dates of the releases is unknown. These tanks, along with the affected soils, were removed in 1985. At that time, it was discovered that onsite and offsite groundwater had become contaminated. \n",

        "    From 1987 through 2000, a groundwater pump and treat system removed approximately 72 million gallons of groundwater and removed approximately 84 pounds of VOCs. By 2000, the operation had successfully reduced the average concentration of trichloroethene (the main VOC) by over 90 percent.  At that time, groundwater extraction had maximized its effectiveness, and per the regulatory approval the system was shut down. The aboveground portion of the groundwater pump and treat system was removed in 2011 at the request of the property owner, and approved by the regulatory agency, to allow additional site commerce.\n",

        "Since 2001, after the pump and treat system was shut down, and natural breakdown (attenuation) of VOCs in groundwater has been occurring at the site. Progress is monitored semiannually and reported annually. Natural attenuation is reducing mass and preventing plume migration.\n",

        "In 2011 to expedite cleanup, additional groundwater treatment occurred onsite using enhanced in situ bioremediation to further reduce VOCs in the groundwater. Trichloroethene (the main VOC) in the enhanced in situ bioremediation treatment area is below the groundwater cleanup goals.\n",
        "The Fourth Five-Year Review Report, completed on September 27, 2012, concluded that the groundwater plume has remained generally stable but a protectiveness determination of the remedy at the Synertek Site could not be made until after a vapor intrusion assessment was completed in the onsite former Synertek building. A vapor intrusion assessment including soil vapor survey was completed in 2013 for the onsite former Synertek building and concluded that the vapor intrusion pathway was not complete or significant under current building use. EPA requested additional indoor air sampling in 2014 with specific requirements for one building on-site and one building off-site.  This sampling was completed in 2015 and showed no evidence of unacceptable vapor intrusion at either the on-property or off-property building.\n",

        "The Naval Air Station (NAS) Moffett Field site is located 35 miles south of San Francisco and approximately 1 mile south of San Francisco Bay in Santa Clara County, California. The former Navy installation consists of approximately 1500 acres and is bounded by former evaporation salt ponds to the north, Stevens Creek to the west, U.S. Highway 101 (Bayshore Freeway) to the south, and the Lockheed Martin Aerospace facility to the east. NAS Moffett Field was commissioned in 1933 to support the \"lighter than air\" (LTA) program. Two years later the LTA program ended, but to support World War II, the LTA program was reactivated and a \"heavier than air\" program began to support fighter planes. The station became the largest naval air transport base on the west coast.\n",

Site 2 was a 1-acre landfill used between the 1940s and 1952.  The combined sites are known as Operable Unit 1 (OU1).  Potential contaminants at Site 1 include volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (thinners, solvents, lacquer), petroleum products (oil, fuel filters), pesticides, sawdust contaminated with transformer oils (possibly containing PCBs) and paints.  Site 2 reportedly received the same types of waste as Site 1. \n",
        "\n",
        "The Final Record of Decision (ROD) for OU1 was signed in 1997 and required consolidation of refuse from Site 2 with that at Site 1, as well as a multilayer cap to contain the wastes.  Refuse from Site 2 was removed, the wastes were placed in the Site 1 landfill and the landfill was \u201ccapped.\u201d Soil samples collected from the Site 2 excavation verified that all wastes had been removed. The Site 2 area was backfilled with clean material, and a fence was installed around the site to restrict access.  Groundwater at Site 2 was tested quarterly through 2002.  Test results consistently showed no contamination.\n",
        "\n",
        "EPA and the Water Board approved closure of Site 2 in early 2003.  Because contaminants were removed, Site 2 was \u201cclean closed\u201d and is available for unrestricted use.\n",
        "\n",
        "At Site 1, the multilayer landfill cap was completed in November 1998.  Long-term maintenance of the cap and monitoring of landfill gas and groundwater at Site 1 began in 1999, to make sure the landfill was not emitting unacceptable levels of gas and that contaminants were not getting into the groundwater or San Francisco Bay.  Raptor perches were installed to naturally control burrowing animals, such as rodents and ground squirrels, that could damage the landfill cap. Several types of hawks and a golden eagle have been seen using the perches.  These perches, in combination with other measures, have been successful in controlling ground squirrels.  The California Integrated Waste Management Board inspected the cap and, in March 2000, approved the site\u2019s closure. \n",
        "\n",
        "Two Five-Year Reviews for OU1 were completed in 2002 and 2007.  The remedy continues to be protective of human health and the environment.  The Navy continues to maintain the Site 1 landfill cap and monitor landfill gas and groundwater.  In 2004, the monitoring changed from quarterly to semiannually based on 5 years of sampling data confirming that contaminants were not being released to the environment.  The Santa Clara County Department of Environmental Health inspects Site 1 quarterly and periodically conducts landfill gas monitoring.   All landfill gas monitoring results showed only very low emissions, well within safe limits. \n",

        "Site 22 \u2013 Golf Course Landfill\n",
        "The Site 22 landfill covers 11 acres.  The Navy operated the landfill from about 1950 to 1967, mainly for domestic waste disposal.  The waste is buried at least 3 feet below the ground surface.  By 1973, the Site 22 landfill had been converted into holes 3, 6 and 7 of the Moffett Field Golf Course.  Between 1994 and 1999, the Navy conducted soil and groundwater studies, called a remedial investigation, and identified the type and extent of contaminants throughout the site.  Soil and groundwater at Site 22 contain VOCs, semivolatile organic compounds and pesticides.  Shallow groundwater beneath the landfill is not used for drinking water.  Groundwater monitoring is being conducted to make sure contaminants are not migrating from the site.\n",
        "\n",
        "The studies also evaluated the potential for landfill gas to build up and migrate from the site. It was found that landfill gases are not escaping into the air or moving underground beyond the site.  The studies concluded that as long as the landfill waste remains buried, there is no risk to human health or the environment.  However, burrowing animals such as ground squirrels, were bringing refuse to the surface, which created a potential risk to human health at the golf course.  This was the primary concern for the site and the focus of the cleanup action. \n",
        "\n",
        "The selected cleanup remedy, a biotic barrier made of gravel and cobblestone was documented in a ROD, which was signed in June 2002 by the Navy, EPA and Water Board.   \u201cBiotic\u201d refers to the fact the barrier will keep out animals. Construction of the biotic barrier was completed in August 2003 and is described in the Navy's April 2004 Remedial Action Report.  The biotic barrier covers the refuse while allowing the landfill to be used as part of a golf course.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular maintenance and long-term monitoring of groundwater and landfill gas is ongoing at Site 22, as required under the September 2003 Post-Construction Operations, Maintenance, and Monitoring Plan.

        "\n",
        "Site 25, located in the northwestern portion of Moffett Field, includes NASA's 175-acre Stormwater Retention Pond and the Eastern Diked Marsh, as well as approximately 52 acres belonging to the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District (MROSD).  Site 25 has been used for the past 50 years by the Navy and NASA to manage stormwater at Moffett Field. Levees border the north and east sides of the Stormwater Retention Pond and the west side of the MROSD parcel.  These levees provide flood protection for Moffett Field and adjacent properties. Historical photographs reveal that levees, blocking the area from tidal flow, were built before Moffett Field was developed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The environment at Site 25 is commonly called a \u201cseasonal wetland\u201d (the area is wet for most of the year due to rainfall but dries out for a certain amount of time each summer or fall).  As a result, Site 25 had been evaluated for a cleanup remedy that would make the site safe for the existing seasonal wetland ecosystem. NASA intends to change the site use to a \u201cmanaged pond.\u201d  This area will serve as the stormwater retention pond during the winter and be kept wet during dry months via a connection to San Francisco Bay.  The other property owner, MROSD, plans to convert its property to a \u201ctidal marsh\u201d by connecting it to San Francisco Bay.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Navy evaluated cleanup scenarios that would allow a managed pond, tidal marsh, and seasonal wetland.  The evaluation included learning what plants and animals live in managed ponds and tidal marshes as compared to seasonal wetlands.  It also involved figuring out the chemical levels that are safe for these plants and animals.  Due to changes in projected future ecological use at the site, the Feasibility Study (FS) was amended with an FS addendum in 2007.   Based on the FS addendum findings, the Navy issued a Proposed Plan in January 2009.  The Proposed Plan recommended restoring Site 25 to a tidal marsh by excavating contaminated sediments, treating certain areas with lead and zinc contamination, and disposing of the sediments off-site.  Following a public comment period on the Proposed Plan, the Navy, with EPA concurrence and State consultation, selected this final cleanup approach in a Record of Decision (ROD) for Site 25 in 2009.  Site 25 cleanup was completed in 2013.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Site 26 -East-Side Aquifer Treatment System (EATS) Area\n",
        "The EATS area is located on the east side of Moffett Field, northeast of Hangar 3. Chlorinated solvents (TCE and PCE) were used at Hangars 2 and 3 and contaminated the groundwater underneath the site. TCE and PCE, as well as their breakdown products (cis-1,2-dichloroethene, 1,1-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride), were identified in groundwater.  The groundwater in the area is not used for drinking water, and no buildings are located over the EATS site.  An ecological risk assessment showed that plants and animals are not at risk from contaminants in groundwater.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cleanup remedy for the EATS area began operating in January 1999.  The remedy includes a groundwater extraction and treatment system consisting of five extraction wells and an air stripper with carbon treatment.  Groundwater is constantly pumped from each extraction well and is treated to remove the contaminants. The treated water is discharged to the Moffett Field storm drain system.  In 2003, EPA and the Water Board approved the EATS Evaluation Work Plan for collecting data to evaluate the effectiveness of EATS. The data would also be used to evaluate other possible methods to clean up the groundwater.  In July 2003, EATS was temporarily turned off to evaluate conditions when no groundwater extraction was occurring.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first Five-Year Review Report for the EATS area, a major milestone document, was approved by EPA in September 2005.  The report recommends completing the work outlined in the EATS Evaluation Work Plan, which would include nutrient enhancement to speed up contaminant breakdown by naturally occurring microorganisms.  In February and March 2005, nutrients, consisting of a product made from corn and corn-based oil, were injected into two \"hot spot\" areas of groundwater.  The nutrients slowly release lactic acid, which is \u201ceaten\u201d by microorganisms in the groundwater.  The microorganisms ultimately break down the solvents in the groundwater, cleaning it up.\n",
        "\n",
        "Groundwater has been monitored for the last several years after the nutrient injection to make sure that it is working.  In 2008, the Navy finalized an evaluation report for the EATS area and proposed conducting a treatability test of an in-situ alternative technology in a \"hot spot\" area of the groundwater contamination plume.  EPA approved the workplan and sampling plan and the Navy started the test in 2009.  Results are back and the Navy is in the process of amending the ROD to select the final remedial approach. \n",
        "\n",
        "Site 27 - Northern Channel\n",
        "Site 27 consists of the Northern Channel and the associated ditches:  Marriage Road Ditch, Patrol Road Ditch and the North Patrol Road Ditch, all of which drain into the Northern Channel. The Northern Channel is located at the northeastern end of Moffett Field, bordered on the north by ponds managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (formerly Cargill Salt evaporation ponds), to the south by Moffett Field and, as the channel extends east, Lockheed Martin property.  The property owners of the Northern Channel have included Cargill Salt, Lockheed Martin, NASA and the City of Sunnyvale.  In addition to the surface water collected by these ditches, the Northern Channel receives stormwater through a system of surface channels and french drains (under the runway); this stormwater is pumped into the channel by the Building 191 lift station. This system is designed to control flooding on the east side of Moffett Field.\n",
        "\n",
        "The 2005 ROD for Site 27 documents the cleanup remedy, which includes the removal of contaminated sediment in the channel and ditches to protect the site\u2019s ecosystem.   Active excavation of contaminated sediment and soils was completed in January 2007.  The Navy completed site restoration activities at Site 27 and  finalized its Remedial Action Completion report in April 2012.\n",
        "\n",
        "Site 28 - West-Side Aquifers Treatment System (WATS) Area \n",
        "The WATS area is located on the west side of the runways, near Hangar 1.  Potential sources of groundwater contamination in the WATS area include a former dry cleaning facility (chlorinated solvents), former fuel storage and wash rack facilities (petroleum hydrocarbons) and former manufacturing facilities south of Moffett Field (chlorinated solvents).  In 1994, the Navy removed contaminants in the soil under Building 88; the process included the demolition of Building 88 and removal of an associated tank and sumps.  The Navy began groundwater extraction and treatment in the Building 88 area the same year.\n",
        "\n",
        "Contamination from dry cleaning activities at Building 88 and fuel operations has mixed with a VOC plume originating from the MEW Superfund Study Area located just south of Moffett Field. The MEW Study Area is named by the streets that generally bounds the area - Middlefield Road, Ellis Street, and Whisman Road . The companies responsible for investigating and cleaning up the MEW Site are collectively called the MEW companies. The contamination plume co-mingled with Navy and MEW contamination is referred to as the \u201cregional groundwater VOC plume\u201d or regional plume. See the Middlefield-Ellis-Whisman (MEW) Study Area for more information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Navy\u2019s groundwater extraction and treatment system is an integral component of the regional groundwater remediation program.  WATS began operating in November 1998. WATS consists of nine extraction wells and a groundwater treatment system located west of Hangar 1.  The extraction wells constantly pump approximately 70 gallons of contaminated groundwater per minute.  This water is treated to remove the contaminants and then discharged to the Moffett Field storm drain system.  The groundwater treatment system includes an advanced oxidation process and granular activated carbon (GAC) vessels.  The GAC vessels were added in July 2001 to \u201cpolish\u201d the treated water.  The majority of the VOCs are chemically changed into carbon dioxide and water, and any remaining contaminants are removed in the GAC vessels.  The Navy modified the treatment system in May 2003 to eliminate VOC air emissions by removing the system\u2019s \u201cair stripper.\u201d \n",
        "\n",
        "The Navy began optimization efforts later in 2003 to accelerate cleanup of the site.  This work included adding the ninth extraction well and collecting data for further evaluation of the former dry cleaning facility, Building 88.  Results of work completed in December 2004 indicated that more fieldwork was needed to evaluate potential sources apparently originating from the Building 88 area. The Navy completed an additional investigation of the former Building 88 area in 2005 and EPA is working closely with the Navy on implementing a pilot test  to reduce mass and cleanup the groundwater faster in this area.\n",
        "\n",
        "Site 29 - Hangar 1\n",
        "Hangar 1 was constructed in 1932 to house the giant airship U.S.S. Macon.  Its floor space covers 8 acres (or the equivalent of 10 football fields) and it stands 200 feet high.  Over the years, the hangar provided space for maintenance of aircraft, training facilities and offices for both the Army and Navy.  Hangar 1 is part of the property transferred to NASA Ames Research Center in 1994.  It formerly housed the Moffett Field Historical Society Museum and was used as a display space for air shows, open houses and various commercial and public functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The building materials and paint used to construct Hangar 1 contain PCBs, asbestos, lead and zinc.  The hangar is aging and its paint and building materials are deteriorating.  As a result, the contaminants in these materials moved into the environment around the hangar and, ultimately, reached Site 25 through the Moffett Field storm drain system.  To ensure the protection of human health and the environment, in 2003 the Navy completed an interim control measure called a time-critical removal action.  This included applying a specialized coating to the exterior surface of Hangar 1 to seal the materials on the building surface. \n",
        "\n",
        "In 2007, the Navy issued a draft revised Engineering Evaluation/ Cost Analysis (EE/CA) recommending removal of the Hangar 1 siding and coating the structural steel frame.  The previous EE/CA (2006) had recommended complete demolition of the Hangar.  The Revised EE/CA was finalized in July 2008.  In January 2009, the Navy signed an Action Memorandum (AM), which declared that the Navy will proceed with the proposed EE/CA alternative, removing the siding and coating the frame.  The Navy has completed the action and the structure is now awaiting a reuse plan by NASA, which will hopefully include re-skinning of the Hangar.    \n",

        "The Intersil/Siemens Superfund Site includes the following three areas:  1) the former Intersil facility, located at 10900 North Tantau Avenue, Cupertino; 2) the former Siemens facility, located at 10950 North Tantau Avenue, Cupertino; and 3) the Off-Site Study Area, located north of and hydraulically downgradient from the two former facilities in Sunnyvale.  Investigations conducted in the 1980s as part of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board's (Regional Board\u2019s) underground storage tank (UST) leak detection program found volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soil on- and off-site.  The primary VOC at the site is trichloroethene (TCE).\n",

Until 1982, liquid wastes were stored in five USTs that were removed in 1982.  From 1982 until cessation of operations, liquid wastes previously stored in USTs were temporarily placed in the hazardous materials storage area for off-site disposal or recycling.  Investigations began in 1982 after the discovery of contaminants during the removal of the USTs.\n",

Regional groundwater elevations rose approximately 50 to 55 feet between 1993 and 1998 from a historic depth of approximately 100 feet below ground surface (bgs).  Based on 2013 water level measurements, groundwater is first encountered beneath the site at depths ranging from approximately 35 to 50 feet bgs.

In 1989, the Regional Board issued site cleanup requirements and approved the work plan and schedule for on- and off-site investigative activities.  In 1990, the EPA selected a remedy to address soil and groundwater contamination at the site.  In 1990, the Regional Board issued Site Cleanup Requirements Order No. 90-119, which requires operation of ongoing remediation systems and groundwater monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Initial Actions\n",
        "Initial actions included the removal of underground waste handling and solvent storage systems and surrounding soil, installation and operation of groundwater extraction systems, and installation and operation of soil vapor extraction systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " Cleanup Ongoing \n",
        " Ongoing cleanup activities include operation of groundwater extraction systems.  Additionally, soil vapor extraction systems were previously operated, as discussed below. \n",

        "Former Intersil Facility\n",
        "A soil vapor extraction system operated from May 1988 to August 1993.  Following the review of soil data collected to confirm that the system had achieved remedial objectives, the Regional Board approved shutdown.  The system consisted of seven vapor extraction wells and eight vent wells.  \n",
        "\n",
        "A groundwater extraction system has been operating at the former Intersil facility since 1987.  The original system consisted of six A4 depth interval extraction wells and one B-zone extraction well.  With Regional Board approval, groundwater extraction from three A4 depth interval wells was curtailed in 2002 and 2003 and extraction from the B-zone well was curtailed in 2006 because of very low TCE concentrations.  A new shallower extraction well was added in 2010.  The current system consists of three wells screened in the A4 depth interval and one well in the A3 depth interval.  Groundwater is being treated using granular activated carbon, and the treated groundwater is discharged to Calabazas Creek under a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from the Regional Board.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most recent vapor intrusion evaluation was completed in the new building at the former Intersil facility in June 2009. Site constituents were not detected in indoor air samples; therefore, the data indicate that unacceptable vapor intrusion is not occurring.\n",
        "\n",
        "Former Siemens Facility\n",
        "Soil excavation in 1991 removed approximately 182 cubic yards of soil containing VOCs and semi-volatile organic compounds.  A soil vapor extraction system operated at the former Siemens facility from 1983 to 2005.  The system was shut down on December 16, 2005.  A VOC rebound study conducted in 2006 showed no significant rebound in the VOC concentrations compared to the baseline samples.  With Regional Board approval, the system was permanently shut off in August 2006 following the sampling for the rebound study.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interim remedial actions for groundwater remediation began in 1986 with start-up of a groundwater extraction system, which extracted on-site groundwater from two A-zone extraction wells.  The system was expanded in 1988 to include a total of five A-zone wells and three B-zone wells.  As part of the final remedy, the system was expanded in 1991 to include ten A-zone extraction wells and three B-zone wells.  Based on mass removal rates, the Regional Board has approved modifications to the extraction well network.  Currently, the groundwater extraction system at the former Siemens facility includes seven A-zone and one B-zone wells.  Groundwater is being treated using granular activated carbon and the treated groundwater is discharged to Calabazas Creek under an NPDES permit from the Regional Board.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bench and pilot studies conducted in 2006 and 2007 evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of bioremediation via enhanced reductive dechlorination (ERD) to improve both the rate and efficiency of VOC mass removal from shallow groundwater at the former Siemens facility.  The studies showed that ERD can reduce TCE concentrations in groundwater, but additional testing is needed to verify complete reduction of TCE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Vapor intrusion evaluations were completed at the former Siemens facility in August 2000, August 2002, November 2002, March 2007, and February 2014. The data indicate that there is no risk to indoor workers associated with constituents of concern reported in subsurface soil or groundwater.\n",

        "Off-Site Study Area\n",
        "Remedial investigations conducted during the 1980s showed impact to the B zone, but no significant impact to the shallow A zone aquifer.  Groundwater extraction from two B-zone wells began in 1990.  This system was later expanded to include an additional B-zone extraction well.  One extraction well was then curtailed in 2004 with Regional Board approval.  Extracted groundwater is pumped to the former Siemens facility for treatment.  Investigation conducted since the water level rise in the 1990s indicated elevated concentrations of VOCs in the A zone.  Additional investigation is ongoing in shallow groundwater. \n",

Three longer-term issues were identified:\n",

        "Issue #2: A minor increasing trend of VOCs at low levels was observed in three B-Zone wells.  A stable trend above cleanup standards was observed in two A- Zone wells and one B-Zone wells. Increasing trends may preliminarily indicate a lack of full control of the TCE plume by the selected remedy (extraction wells) and stable trends may preliminarily indicate ineffectiveness of the current remedy in achieving cleanup standards.\n",
