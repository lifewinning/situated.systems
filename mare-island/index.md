<p>Following its closure and decommissioning in 1996, the contents of Mare Island Naval Shipyard were auctioned off to the public in 2002. The heavy industrial machine tools that had previously been utilized to build and repair warships and submarines found their way into new hands and new uses across the Bay Area. During this project, we tracked down a number of these machines and their new operators. Photogrammetry techniques and digital fabrication processes were used to capture them, allowing these large and complex machines to be seen, handled and reproduced beyond the specific workshop environments where they are used.</p>
<p>
The Kit is intended to extend our conception of warfare beyond the battlefield to consider the role of industrial machinery, construction, and maintenance in military spaces; and highlight the many contexts in which military tools exist over their lifespan.

The pop-out toy grid was developed in collaboration with Maria Yablonina.
