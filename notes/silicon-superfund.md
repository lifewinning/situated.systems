### Anecdotals

- Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation (FMC) producing armaments in WWII

### Questions

- Defense contracts received by Santa Clara County 
- San Jose annexation wars
- Campaign to Ban TCE, San Jose
- Reminder to look both in EPA and US Department of Health and Human Services etc

### Notes

- Introducing some of this to D&S will entail a little bit of "here's what's inside your machine and how it works" talk hmm

- Corporate campus design and vibes at Stanford University: 

> "light industry of a non-nuisance type...which will create a demand for technical employees of a high salary class that will be in a financial position to live in this area." The well-paid, educated worker in the industrial park made a "very desirable kind of resident" for the community, according to the president of the Stanford Board of Trustees; employers should expect the suburban environs of the park to "attract a better class of workers." (David Packard, Stanford trustee, quoted in 1960)

- In the 1980s, state and federal regulations didn't require testing for industrial chemicals--only viruses, bacteria, pesticides, and herbicides

- As of 1992, 57 private and 47 public drinking wells were contaminated, "66 plots of land have been declared too toxic for human beings to walk on."

- "In 1999, on average, the production of an 8-inch silicon wafer required the following resources: 4,267 cubic feet of bulk gases, 3,787 gallons of waste water, 27 pounds of chemicals, 29 cubic feet of hazardous gases, 9 pounts of hazardous waste, and 3,023 gallons of deionized water."

- Confluence of events lead to extremely toxic tech production: 
	- production needs: i.e., certain chemicals increase conductivity in silicon
	- military demand: the specifications for military production don't necessarily relate to social needs--"for instance, military specifications for many electronics demand use of CFC-113 as a solvent of choice. CFC-113 is one of the main destroyers of the Earth's protective ozone layer..."
	- simultaneous revolution in synthetic chemical production

- Gallium Arsenide chips vs Silicon chips

- Lorenz Barrel and Drun: hazardous waste treatment company based in south San Jose "half a block from Mi Tierra, one of San Jose's first community gardens." Shut dwon in 1986 by federal authorities for criminal violations. Remediation was, essentially, an asphalt cap. ("some modicum of justice" achieved, etc)

- Racial dynamics of industry at the time: 
	- 1980: ~88% of managers in tech in Santa Clara County were white, while only 41% of laborers were white. 4% of managers were Latino while 34% of laborers were Latino.

- Accountability at this time was slippery because the Bureau of Labor Statistics had defined a workplace injury as an event "which results from a work accident of from an exposure involving a sincle incident...occurring in one instant." The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) took advantage of this in the creation of its Occupational Health System, classifying one-time chemical exposures as "injuries" rather than illnesses, which made tracking the long-term illnesses brought on by chemical exposure difficult.

- Another accountability roadblock lies in the fact that pinpointing *which* unbelievably scary chemical used in this process caused irreparable harm is really, really difficult--which makes banning or improving workplace safety difficult and makes it hard to bring forward legal claims

- Whole other rabbit hole into PCB production in prisons agh

- "Vapor Plumes": when chemicals from groundwater contamination rise up from the soil, releasing them into the atmosphere

- water use in semiconductor manufacturing
