Mount Diablo,y,dc,"Mount Diablo's prominence made it a reference point for early surveys of California and Nevada. A beacon on the summit was first lit in 1928, one of five on the West Coast which helped guide planes. The beacon was extinguished the day after Pearl Harbor, amidst fears that it would facilitate a Japanese attack on California. The invention of radar made the beacon obsolete by the end of the war.","Mount Diablo's prominence made it a reference point for early surveys of California and Nevada, and a beacon on the summit was first lit in 1928 to help guide planes.

Port of Oakland,y,dc,"The shipping cranes of the Port of Oakland tower over the east side of the Bay, like gigantic skeletal beasts at the water's edge.

Today, Oakland is the 5th-busiest port in the United States.","The shipping cranes of the Port of Oakland tower over the east side of the Bay, like gigantic skeletal beasts at the water's edge.
