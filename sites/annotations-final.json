The parent company's military connections were likely why Sherman Fairchild understood the potential of solid-state electronics as a key technology at the dawn of the space age (Sputnik was also launched in 1957), including the then-novel use of silicon as a substrate, as it is more stable at high temperatures than germanium and thus better suited for military applications.","photo":"n","superfund":"n","military":"n","etc":"","":"op"}

While its fortunes have declined considerably following the advent of solid-state electronics, the company still manufactures tubes for niche and industrial applications at a Palo Alto facility.","military_text":"Immediately prior to the start of World War II, Eitel-McCullough worked closely with military researchers working on the then-secret radar technologies, and designed specialized tubes for radar applications. While Eitel-McCullough didn't initially receive the military contract, their contacts at the research labs advocated for the use of their tubes in production. As Eitel-McCullough ramped up its workforce for military production, a drive for unionization was averted by offering amenities, including generous pensions, profit-sharing, and a subsidized cafeteria, in an early example of Silicon Valley-style welfare capitalism.","photo":"n","superfund":"n","military":"n","etc":"","":""}

{"placename":"Richmond Shipyards","text":"The first Richmond Shipyard was established as part of the Kaiser Shipyards in 1940 to build ships for the British navy; with the entrance of the United States into World War II, it was expanded into four shipyards that eventually produced more vessels that any other site during the war, turning out 747 ships. By the end of the war, the time taken to assemble a single ship was just over two weeks; this was achieved by the use of manufacturing techniques including assembly lines, prefabrication and, notably, welding instead of riveting. These techniques allowed the use of relatively unskilled labor, which resulted in the operators of the site, Permanente Metals, actively recruiting women and minorities to help meet their expanding workforce needs.","military_text":"The popular images of \"Rosie the Riveter\" (and her lesser-known sister, Wendy the Welder) derive from the wartime entry of women into the workforce at facilities such as Richmond Shipyard. These are commemorated at the Rosie the Riveter National Historic Park at the preserved Shipyard #3 on the Richmond waterfront.\n\nWith the massive increase in workforce at the new shipyards set up in the Bay Area at the start of World War II, the Kaiser company arranged for medical insurance for workers, paid for by both the company and individuals, to cover both work-related injuries and general medical care. These insurance arrangements and the associated medical practices have since grown into Kaiser Permanente, now the largest managed care provider in the United States, which is headquartered in Oakland, California.","photo":"n","superfund":"n","military":"y","etc":"","":""}
