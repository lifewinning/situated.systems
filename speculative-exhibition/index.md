<h3>About</h3>

<p>The Experimental Research Lab co-founders asked us to engage—with the immediate landscape, with the community of Pier 9, and with audiences in San Francisco. They asked us what we could do that was unique to their facility—how we could enact things that could only happen there. Though their use of the word “engagement” implied a particular type of making, leveraging the unique immense resources of the facilities and its knowledgeable minders, we chose to view it more broadly.</p>

<p>Our original proposal included the idea of walkshops, a strategy by which we would lead participants in investigations of the physical environment surrounding Pier 9. However, iterative conversations about engagement increasingly caused us to consider ways in which we could intervene, supplement, and contextualize the everyday experience within Pier 9 for its own staff, while also adding to the fabric of the environment in a way that could be meaningful for both insiders and outsiders.</p>

<p>In response, we increasingly focused on the Pier 9 as a viewshed to various perspectives. The Pier’s geographic location situates the facility within a physical and conceptual triangulation of military, industrial, and environmental history. Standing at south-facing windows, a viewer may see the cranes of the Port of Oakland and, further, shadowy forms of the Alameda Naval Air Station; further to the South, a viewer may be aware of ghosts of the industrial history—revealed in locations such as the Hills Brothers Coffee Sign on a building near the Bay Bridge and Hunter’s Point Naval Shipyard further down the Bay. At north-facing windows the viewer is immediately confronted by the structure of Pier 15, a site which served as a major management and embarkation point for the military during WWII; the Liberty Ship resides further North on the Embarcadero, with Fort Mason and the Presidio–both sites integral to centuries of Bay military history–located just beyond. Standing outside of Pier 9 on either side, a viewer who faces East towards the Bay views Treasure Island—a key military location that was active throughout the 20th century, whose landscape currently lies dormant due to environmental toxicity resulting from its previous operations. There are, of course, many relevant sites that can’t be as easily visually inferred from Pier 9, including the Mare Island and Richmond shipyards to the North and sites of environmental impact within Silicon Valley to the South, to name just a few.</p>

<p>To intervene in the space, supplement the existing environment, and contextualize the work occurring at the Pier, we focused on four major tactics. Pier 9 is an active workplace; we first felt it important to operate in ways that could impact the everyday fabric of the environment. We sought opportunities to place project materials in workspaces rather than designated exhibit areas. Second, in order to critically interrogate the work of Pier 9, we looked for locations to juxtapose our items in ways that could create dialogue; by placing items in relation to existing Pier environments, machines, and views, we aimed to trigger interrogation of the Pier’s work within the larger Bay history, within an expanded view of purpose and perspective, and within a sense of both chronological and physical scale. Third, as a nod to the Pier of a place fundamentally engaged with materials and making, we sought opportunities to converse with the physical materials of the place. And fourth, by utilizing the first three tactics, we aimed to change the view of the viewsheds themselves—literally altering views of the Pier’s windows, alongside activating various aspects of the environment to become portals for productions of meaning.</p>

<p>We imagined blatant interventions, such as window overlays that would literally frame a person’s view, and subtleties, such as hanging experimental zine pages made of plywood on wooden walls to both juxtapose materiality and have the piece be something so integrated into the environment that it could feasibly be missed. Our tone leaned more towards tweaking the environment than causing tumult. These interventions were fundamentally inspired by artistic and theoretical modes of seeing, such as Ad Reinhart’s black paintings—canvases covered in layers of paint with subtle differences that can only be seen when really stared at, Joseph Kosuth’s object juxtapositions (rooted in his theories of the “production of meaning”), and John Dewey’s definitions of art as experience. Both Kosuth and Dewey wrote at length about a work of art being the result of a combination of materiality—and the inferences those materials bring, artist’s intent, and the information brought by the personal background of a viewer’s gaze. We took all three aspects into account as we imagined the possibilities.</p>

<p>After working with Pier 9 staff to interrogate what areas (not typically used for exhibits) we could activate and which would need additional consideration, we ultimately chose to conceive of the exhibit as speculative rather than physical so that we could have the most imaginative flexibility. We identified locations based on materiality, line of sight, everyday occupation, and potential meaningful intersections with the stories that we wanted to tell.</p>

<h3>Components</h3>

<p><em>We modified existing floor plans, annotated them with photographs, and iteratively notated them throughout conversations with Pier 9 staff.</em></p>

<p>Within the speculative exhibit, we imaged that items would be placed in juxtaposition to windows, walls, and other types of surfaces (including rafters, bookshelves, and tables). Though this process included additional investigations of surfaces of interest, we offer some of our choices below.</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>

<p>Windows were activated to modify the literal views from the Pier. These modifications connected the pier to places nearby (such as the Alameda Naval Air Station) or further afield (such as key tech history sites within Silicon Valley).</p>

<p>Additional interventions could include translucent overlays on windows in the Pier 9 Arcade, metal and/or wood shop, kitchen, and Studio 9 spaces. These overlays would relate to footprints indicated on the ground beneath them, specifically framing a visitor’s view with additional information about locations that could be either seen or inferred from the specific view. In the process of developing the exhibit, we investigated means by which to create these overlays as drawings to include solar-powered electronic highlights, using conductive ink and/or thread.</p>

<p>We also looked at glass walls that served as thresholds between spaces—between the kitchen and the hallway and between the shipping area and the workspace. Though they were intriguing, we chose not to use those areas, as we did not have existing content that would bring new perspectives for those specific spaces.</p>

<h4>Walls</h4>

<p>We sought walls that were not typically used to exhibit artist-in-residence materials, particularly those that Pier 9 staff might encounter on a daily basis. We looked at available space in conference and phone rooms; we were limited by those walls that weren’t treated with white board paint or otherwise already occupied with art. We also investigated walls that were parts of nooks, such as the Moby Dick space that caused a user to feel as if they were sitting within a slatted wood womb.</p>

<p>We chose one wall for our primary use. Made of a light wood, the pages of the experimental zine could nearly disappear into the surface if you were to just pass by. It also faced both the artists-in-residence area, in general, and a seating area, specifically. If noticed, the pages could create a visual focus for the space. As an alternative to a single installation, the pages could also be scattered throughout the wood walls of the artists-in-residence space. Our choice to play off of the similarity of materials was deliberate; the stories of the decommissioned military sites created context for Pier 9’s own work. We placed the Treasure Island “historic plaque” page over the desk of the Bay area-native artist who’d originally suggested that we look into Treasure Island as a research site.</p>

<h4>Surfaces</h4>

<p>Our possibilities for the use of non-wall surfaces varied widely.</p>

<p>Our icons and Mare Island machines could easily be integrated within existing shelves of objects, placed within the print lab, made at the Pier.</p>

<p><em>items integrated into object shelves in the Pier 9 print shop; photograph by Blue Bergen.</em></p>

<p>Our icon of material scientist Ursula Franklin fit naturally within the tool shelves of the wood shop, serving as an intelligent, theoretical reminder within the very mechanical place.</p>

<p>Similarly, Donna Haraway was a natural fit to oversee the electronics lab. We made it into a place now all watched over by the Donna Haraway of Loving Grace.</p>

<p><img src="images/Situated-Systems_16-0608_37.JPG" class="img-responsive">

<p>We integrated copies from our zine series, named after Haraway’s essay “Situated Knowledges,” into the Pier 9 library and general news-reading spaces. By placing our materials within seemingly similar ones, we tweaked the landscape only slightly while still providing new perspectives.</p>

<p>Though many of the interventions that we’ve mentioned up to this point could be realistic, one crucial one could only happen through the speculative process. Tiny, 3D-printed Mare Island machines (the result of Georgina’s scanning of historic machines) served as evocative juxtapositions to the larger machines of the Pier 9 shops.</p>

<p>And we utilized our project stickers, modified from historic stickers found on the Mare Island machines, to identify those machines that served as our most crucial “Mission Support.” These machines included the 3D printer used to print the Mare Island machines, our extensive use of hand tools, and the Pier 9 staff themselves.</p>

<p>Given the portable nature of some of our project items, additional opportunities exist to additionally scatter elements throughout the space. For instance, additional site boxes could be integrated within the collections of playful objects that exist throughout the space, and the digital bibliography and annotated map could be left on tablets placed adjacent to casual seating areas.</p></html>
